"""
Seeder & realtime fetch orchestrator.

Functions:
- ensure_region(region): if longterm CSV already at MAX_PER_REGION → skip.
  Otherwise top up per-type using cross-type back-fill policy (A).
  Returns dict {type_key: count_now, "total": N, "skipped": bool}.

- fetch_realtime_into_tempo(session_id, regions): scrape live, write to tempo
  JSON keyed by region+session_id, plus append-only into long-term CSV.
  Persists partial results: every successful per-type scrape is appended to
  both stores BEFORE moving on, so a later failure does not lose earlier work.

- load_demo_into_tempo(session_id, regions): copy from long-term CSV into the
  same tempo JSON shape (no network).

- run_with_retry_then_demo(coro_factory, retries=3): runs the supplied async
  coroutine; on three consecutive failures it switches to demo and sets the
  global `forced_demo` flag.
